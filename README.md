## Why Subgeneratorr?

I built this tool to solve a persistent problem in my media library: **hundreds of episodes missing subtitles**. While [Bazarr](https://www.bazarr.media/) does an excellent job finding subtitles for most content, there are always gaps like obscure shows, older episodes, or content that doesn't have community-contributed subtitles available.

I looked around for options with free trials but most only gave a couple hours free and then required subscription. Deepgram's $200 free signup credit offer was the best deal I could find. Their Nova-3 model produces high-quality transcriptions at ~$0.004/minute, and adding keyterms‚Äîcharacter names, locations, and show-specific terminology‚Äîdramatically improves accuracy for proper nouns that would otherwise be misrecognized. This creates subtitles that fill the gaps in your library without requiring intensive manual correction. It's not perfect, but it's very useful for jargon heavy dialogue.

**Subgeneratorr is for media enthusiasts** who care about complete subtitle coverage, accessibility, and having a polished library experience in Plex, Jellyfin, or Emby.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/subgeneratorr.git
cd subgeneratorr

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your DEEPGRAM_API_KEY

# Build and start
docker compose build
```

### Basic Usage

**Process entire media library:**
```bash
docker compose run --rm deepgram-cli
```

**Process specific show/season:**
```bash
docker compose run --rm -e MEDIA_PATH=/media/tv/ShowName/Season\ 01 deepgram-cli
```

**Process with transcripts and speaker labels:**
```bash
docker compose run --rm -e ENABLE_TRANSCRIPT=1 deepgram-cli
```

**Force regenerate existing subtitles:**
```bash
docker compose run --rm -e FORCE_REGENERATE=1 deepgram-cli
```

---

## Web UI (Optional)

The Web UI provides a browser-based interface for remote management, batch processing, and AI-powered keyterm generation.

### Start Web UI

```bash
# Using make
make web-up

# Or using docker compose
docker compose up -d redis deepgram-web deepgram-worker
```

Access at `http://localhost:5000` (or configure reverse proxy for remote access)

### Web UI Features

- üåê **Remote access** from any device
- üìä **Real-time progress tracking** with per-file status
- ü§ñ **AI Keyterm Generation** with Claude or GPT (optional)
- üìÅ **Directory browser** for easy file selection
- üîÑ **Bazarr integration** for automatic subtitle rescans
- ‚ö° **Batch processing** with parallel workers

---

## Key Features Explained

### Keyterm Prompting

Improve transcription accuracy by up to 90% for important terms like character names, locations, and show-specific jargon.

**Create keyterms CSV:**
```bash
# For TV shows (at show level)
/media/tv/Breaking Bad/Transcripts/Keyterms/Breaking Bad_keyterms.csv

# Format: one term per line
Walter White
Jesse Pinkman
Heisenberg
Los Pollos Hermanos
```

**Or use AI generation** (Web UI only):
- Select video ‚Üí Open Advanced Options ‚Üí Generate Keyterms with AI
- Supports Anthropic Claude and OpenAI GPT
- Costs ~$0.002-0.08 per generation depending on model

### Speaker Maps

Replace generic "Speaker 0", "Speaker 1" labels with character names in transcripts.

**Create speaker map:**
```bash
# At show level
/media/tv/Breaking Bad/Transcripts/Speakermap/speakers.csv

# CSV format
speaker_id,name
0,Walter White
1,Jesse Pinkman
```

Auto-detected when you enable transcript generation (`ENABLE_TRANSCRIPT=1`)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Key settings in `.env`:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` | Deepgram API key (required) | - |
| `MEDIA_PATH` | Media directory to scan | `/media` |
| `LANGUAGE` | Language code (`en`, `es`, `fr`, etc.) | `en` |
| `ENABLE_TRANSCRIPT` | Generate speaker-labeled transcripts | `0` |
| `FORCE_REGENERATE` | Regenerate existing subtitles | `0` |
| `PROFANITY_FILTER` | Filter mode: `off`, `tag`, or `remove` | `off` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | For AI keyterm generation (optional) | - |

### Docker Compose Setup

Copy the example configuration:
```bash
cp examples/docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
```

Update media paths for your platform:

**Linux:**
```yaml
volumes:

```

**macOS:**
```yaml
volumes:
  - /Users/username/Videos:/media
```

**Windows:**
```yaml
volumes:

## Media Server Integration

Generated `.eng.srt` files are automatically recognized by:

- **Plex** - Shows as "English (SRT External)"
- **Jellyfin** - Auto-detected with proper language tags
- **Emby** - Supports ISO-639-2 language codes
- **Bazarr** - Use as fallback when online subtitles unavailable

After generation, refresh your media library to detect new subtitles.

---

## Common Workflows

### Fill Subtitle Gaps After Bazarr

1. Let Bazarr find subtitles for most content
2. Run Subgeneratorr on your media directory (skips files with subtitles)
3. Only processes files missing subtitles
4. Refresh Plex/Jellyfin library

### Batch Process New TV Season

1. Download new season via Sonarr/Radarr
2. Run: `docker compose run --rm -e MEDIA_PATH=/media/tv/ShowName/Season\ 01 deepgram-cli`
3. Subtitles generated automatically
4. Bazarr rescan triggers (if Web UI integration enabled)

### Generate Transcripts for Archive

1. Create keyterms CSV with character names
2. Create speaker map CSV
3. Run with transcripts enabled: `docker compose run --rm -e ENABLE_TRANSCRIPT=1 deepgram-cli`
4. Get both `.eng.srt` subtitles and `.transcript.speakers.txt` files

---

## Troubleshooting

### Videos Being Skipped

Files are skipped if `.eng.srt` already exists. Use `FORCE_REGENERATE=1` to reprocess.

### Permission Errors (Linux)

Set `PUID` and `PGID` in docker-compose.yml to match your user:
```bash
id -u  # Get your UID
id -g  # Get your GID
```

### API Errors

- Verify API key in `.env`
- Check account balance at [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com/)
- Ensure sufficient credits

### Keyterms Not Loading

- Check file location: `{Show}/Transcripts/Keyterms/{ShowName}_keyterms.csv`
- Verify UTF-8 encoding
- Ensure filename matches show directory name exactly
