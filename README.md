cd deepgram-subtitles
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and add your Deepgram API key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your API key:

```
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 3. Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker compose build
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Configure the application using environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` | (required) | Your Deepgram API key |
| `MEDIA_PATH` | `/media` | Path to scan for videos (inside container) |
| `FILE_LIST_PATH` | - | Path to text file with specific videos to process |
| `LOG_PATH` | `/logs` | Directory for processing logs |
| `BATCH_SIZE` | `0` | Max videos per run (0 = unlimited) |
| `LANGUAGE` | `en` | Language code (e.g., `en`, `es`, `fr`) |
| `ENABLE_TRANSCRIPT` | `0` | Set to `1` to enable speaker-labeled transcript generation |
| `FORCE_REGENERATE` | `0` | Set to `1` to regenerate SRT files even if they already exist |

### Docker Compose Configuration

A complete `docker-compose.example.yml` is provided in the [`examples/`](examples/) directory with both CLI and Web UI services configured. Copy it to `docker-compose.yml` and customize the media paths:

```bash
cp examples/docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
```

**Important:** Update `/path/to/your/media` in `docker-compose.yml` to point to your actual media directory.

#### Platform-Specific Volume Paths

The volume mount paths in your `docker-compose.yml` file differ by platform:

**Linux:**
```yaml
volumes:
  - /home/username/Videos:/media
  - /mnt/media:/media
```

**macOS:**
```yaml
volumes:
  - /Users/username/Videos:/media
  - /Volumes/MediaDrive:/media
```

**Windows:**
```yaml
volumes:
  # Option 1: Windows-style path
  - C:/Users/YourName/Videos:/media
  
  # Option 2: WSL2 path format
  - /c/Users/YourName/Videos:/media
  
  # For network drives
  - //server/share:/media
```

**Note:** The `PUID` and `PGID` environment variables are primarily for Linux file permissions. On Windows and macOS with Docker Desktop, you can keep the default values (1000) or omit them entirely.

## Subtitle File Naming

This tool generates subtitle files with proper ISO-639-2 language tags (e.g., `.eng.srt`) to ensure automatic recognition by Plex, Jellyfin, and other media servers. This prevents subtitles from appearing as "Unknown (SRT External)" and instead displays them as "English (SRT External)" or the appropriate language.

### Generated Files

For a video file `Movie.mkv`, the following files are created:
- `Movie.eng.srt` - English subtitles (automatically recognized by media servers)

If transcript generation is enabled (`ENABLE_TRANSCRIPT=1`), a `Transcripts/` folder is created:
```
Movie Directory/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Movie.mkv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Movie.eng.srt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Transcripts/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Movie.transcript.speakers.txt  # Speaker-labeled transcript
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ JSON/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Movie.deepgram.json        # Raw API response (if enabled)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Keyterms/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Movie_keyterms.csv         # Auto-saved keyterms (if enabled)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Speakermap/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ speakers.csv                # Per-show/movie speaker map (optional)
```

### Renaming Existing Subtitles

If you have existing subtitle files without language tags or with incorrect tags, use the included [`scripts/postprocess_subtitles.py`](scripts/postprocess_subtitles.py) script:

```bash
# Preview what would be renamed (dry run)
python3 scripts/postprocess_subtitles.py --dry-run /path/to/media/

# Rename a single file
python3 scripts/postprocess_subtitles.py /path/to/Movie.srt

# Rename all subtitles in a directory
python3 scripts/postprocess_subtitles.py /path/to/media/

# Process specific files
python3 scripts/postprocess_subtitles.py file1.srt file2.en.srt file3.srt
```

The script will:
- Convert `*.srt` ‚Üí `*.eng.srt` (if no other language subtitles exist)
- Convert `*.en.srt` ‚Üí `*.eng.srt`
- Skip files that already have proper `.eng.srt` naming
- Provide detailed feedback on what was renamed or skipped

After renaming, you may need to refresh your Plex or Jellyfin library and clear the transcode cache:

```bash
# For Plex (Docker):
docker exec -it plex rm -rf "/config/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Cache/Transcode/*"
```

## Usage

### Process Entire Media Library

Scan and process all videos without subtitles:

```bash
docker compose run --rm deepgram-cli
```

### Process Specific Directory

Process a specific show or directory:

```bash
docker compose run --rm -e MEDIA_PATH=/media/tv/ShowName deepgram-cli
```

### Process Specific Season

```bash
docker compose run --rm -e MEDIA_PATH=/media/tv/ShowName/Season\ 01 deepgram-cli
```

### Process From File List

Create a text file with video paths (one per line):

```bash
# video-list.txt
/media/tv/Show1/Season 01/episode1.mkv
/media/tv/Show2/Season 02/episode5.mkv
/media/movies/Movie.mp4
```

Then process:

```bash
docker compose run --rm -e FILE_LIST_PATH=/config/video-list.txt deepgram-cli
```

### Batch Processing

Limit processing to a specific number of videos:

```bash
docker compose run --rm -e BATCH_SIZE=10 deepgram-cli
```

### Process Non-English Content

```bash
docker compose run --rm -e LANGUAGE=es deepgram-cli
```

### Generate Speaker-Labeled Transcripts

Enable transcript generation with speaker diarization:

```bash
docker compose run --rm -e ENABLE_TRANSCRIPT=1 deepgram-cli
```

This will generate:
- Standard `.eng.srt` subtitle files (properly tagged for media servers)
- `.transcript.speakers.txt` files with speaker-labeled dialogue (with speaker diarization)
- `.deepgram.json` debug files with raw API responses (if enabled in code)

To use character name mapping, create speaker map CSV files in the `speaker_maps/` directory. See [Speaker Maps](#speaker-maps) for details.

### Regenerate SRT Files

If you have videos with existing SRT files that have errors, missing parts, or other problems, you can force regeneration:

```bash
docker compose run --rm -e FORCE_REGENERATE=1 deepgram-cli
```

This will:
- Process all videos in the scan path, even if they already have SRT files
- Overwrite existing SRT files with newly generated ones
- Work with both directory scanning and file list modes
- Respect BATCH_SIZE limits

**Use cases for force regeneration:**
- SRT files with transcription errors or poor quality
- Videos missing portions of dialogue in subtitles
- Need to regenerate with a different model or language setting
- Corrupted or incomplete subtitle files

**Example: Regenerate for a specific show**
```bash
docker compose run --rm -e FORCE_REGENERATE=1 -e MEDIA_PATH=/media/tv/ShowName deepgram-cli
```

**Example: Regenerate from a file list**
```bash
docker compose run --rm -e FORCE_REGENERATE=1 -e FILE_LIST_PATH=/config/problem-files.txt deepgram-cli
```

**Note:** Force regeneration will incur API costs for all processed videos, so use with care. Consider using BATCH_SIZE to limit costs.

## Keyterm Prompting

Keyterm Prompting allows you to improve Keyword Recall Rate (KRR) for important keyterms or phrases by up to 90%. This feature is available for **Nova-3 model with monolingual transcription only**.

### What to Include as Keyterms

**Good keyterm examples:**
- **Character names**: Walter White, Daenerys Targaryen, Michael Scott
- **Show-specific terms**: TARDIS, Vibranium, Dunder Mifflin, Heisenberg
- **Location names**: Westeros, Albuquerque, King's Landing
- **Industry-specific terminology**: Medical terms (tretinoin, diagnosis), technical jargon (escalation, API)
- **Product and company names**: Brand names, service names
- **Proper nouns**: Names, brands, titles with appropriate capitalization (Deepgram, iPhone, Dr. Smith)

**What to avoid:**
- **Generic common words**: Very common words rarely misrecognized (the, and, is)
- **Excessive keyterms**: Stay well under the 500 token limit; focus on the most important 20-50 terms

### Keyterm Limits

- **Maximum**: 500 tokens per request
- **Recommended**: 20-50 focused keyterms for best results
- **Token estimation**: Approximately 1.3 tokens per word

### CSV Keyterms Management

Keyterms are stored in CSV files alongside your media content for automatic reuse across episodes.

#### CSV File Format

**Location:** `Transcripts/Keyterms/{show_or_movie_name}_keyterms.csv`

**Format:** Simple CSV with one keyterm per line (no header required)

```csv
Walter White
Jesse Pinkman
Heisenberg
Los Pollos Hermanos
Albuquerque
methylamine
pseudoephedrine
DEA
```

**CSV Rules:**
- One keyterm per line
- No header row needed
- Empty lines are ignored
- Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments
- UTF-8 encoding for international characters
- Case-sensitive (preserve proper capitalization)

#### File Naming Convention

The CSV filename is automatically determined from your media path:

**For TV Shows:**
```
/media/tv/Breaking Bad/Season 01/episode.mkv
‚Üí Transcripts/Keyterms/Breaking Bad_keyterms.csv
```

**For Movies:**
```
/media/movies/Inception (2010)/movie.mkv
‚Üí Transcripts/Keyterms/Inception (2010)_keyterms.csv
```

The keyterms file is **shared across all episodes** of a show or all files in a movie directory.

### Using Keyterms with CLI

The CLI **automatically loads** keyterms from CSV files - no manual configuration required!

```bash
# Keyterms auto-loaded from Transcripts/Keyterms/{show}_keyterms.csv
docker compose run --rm deepgram-cli
```

**Example CLI Output:**
```
üé¨ Processing: Breaking.Bad.S01E01.mkv
  üìã Auto-loaded 23 keyterms from CSV
  ‚è±Ô∏è  Duration: 47.2 min | Cost: $0.20
  üì¢ Extracting audio...
  üß† Transcribing (nova-3)...
  üíæ Generating SRT...
  ‚úÖ SRT created: Breaking.Bad.S01E01.eng.srt
```

**To create a keyterms file for CLI use:**

1. Process one episode to generate the directory structure
2. Create the keyterms CSV manually:
   ```bash
   cd "/media/tv/Breaking Bad/Season 01"
   mkdir -p Transcripts/Keyterms
   cat > Transcripts/Keyterms/"Breaking Bad_keyterms.csv" << EOF
   Walter White
   Jesse Pinkman
   Heisenberg
   Los Pollos Hermanos
   EOF
   ```
3. Future episodes will automatically use these keyterms

### Using Keyterms with Web UI

The Web UI provides an integrated keyterms interface with automatic save/load functionality.

#### Web UI Features

- **Text input field**: Enter keyterms separated by commas
- **Auto-load**: Existing keyterms automatically populate from CSV
- **Auto-save**: Keyterms automatically saved to CSV when you transcribe
- **Per-directory**: Keyterms stored with the media files
- **Reusable**: Same keyterms used for all episodes/files in that show/movie

#### Using the Web UI

1. **Select videos** to transcribe
2. **Enter keyterms** in the "Keyterm Prompting" field:
   ```
   Walter White, Jesse Pinkman, Heisenberg, Albuquerque
   ```
3. **Click Transcribe** - keyterms are automatically saved to CSV
4. **Next time**: Keyterms auto-load when you browse to that directory

**Note:** Keyterms are automatically saved every time you transcribe with keyterms entered. You don't need to manually save them.

#### API Endpoints (Advanced Users)

**Upload keyterms CSV:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/keyterms/upload \
  -F "file=@keyterms.csv" \
  -F "video_path=/media/tv/Show/episode.mkv"
```

**Download keyterms CSV:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/keyterms/download?video_path=/media/tv/Show/episode.mkv" \
  -o keyterms.csv
```

### Workflow Examples

#### Scenario 1: New TV Show

1. **First Episode:**
   - Select episode in Web UI
   - Enter keyterms: `Tony Soprano, Christopher Moltisanti, Bada Bing, Newark`
   - Click Transcribe
   - Keyterms saved to `Transcripts/Keyterms/The Sopranos_keyterms.csv`

2. **Subsequent Episodes:**
   - Select any episode from "The Sopranos"
   - Keyterms automatically loaded and displayed
   - Click Transcribe (same keyterms reused)

#### Scenario 2: Batch Processing with CLI

1. **Prepare keyterms** for your show:
   ```bash
   cd "/media/tv/Your Show/Season 01"
   mkdir -p Transcripts/Keyterms
   nano Transcripts/Keyterms/"Your Show_keyterms.csv"
   ```

2. **Run CLI** to process entire season:
   ```bash
   docker compose run --rm \
     -e MEDIA_PATH="/media/tv/Your Show/Season 01" \
     deepgram-cli
   ```

3. **Keyterms automatically applied** to all 24 episodes

#### Scenario 3: Movie with Technical Terms

1. **Create keyterms file:**
   ```
   /media/movies/Interstellar (2014)/Transcripts/Keyterms/Interstellar (2014)_keyterms.csv
   ```
   
2. **Add technical terms:**
   ```csv
   Cooper
   TARS
   CASE
   Gargantua
   tesseract
   relativity
   ```

3. **Process movie** - keyterms improve accuracy for sci-fi terminology

### Best Practices

1. **Start with 20-30 keyterms** - most important names and terms
2. **Use proper capitalization** - helps with accuracy (iPhone not iphone)
3. **One keyterms file per show** - shared across all episodes/seasons
4. **Update as needed** - add new characters/terms when they appear
5. **Test first episode** - verify keyterms work before batch processing
6. **Include variations** - "Dr. Smith" and "Doctor Smith" if both are used
7. **Avoid over-prompting** - too many keyterms can reduce effectiveness

### Troubleshooting

**Keyterms not loading:**
- Check file exists: `Transcripts/Keyterms/{show_name}_keyterms.csv`
- Verify filename matches show directory name exactly
- Check CSV encoding (must be UTF-8)
- Look for CLI message: `üìã Auto-loaded X keyterms from CSV`

**Keyterms not improving accuracy:**
- Ensure using Nova-3 model (keyterms only work with Nova-3)
- Verify language is monolingual (not multilingual detection)
- Check keyterm count (20-50 recommended, 500 token limit)
- Try more specific terms (full names better than first names)

**CSV file not created:**
- Ensure write permissions on media directory
- Check `Transcripts/` folder exists and is writable
- Verify you're using Web UI auto-save (CLI only reads, doesn't write)

### Technical Details

- **API Parameter**: Keyterms passed as `keyterm` array in Deepgram API options
- **Model Requirement**: Nova-3 only (Nova-2 does not support keyterms)
- **Language Requirement**: Monolingual only (single language code like `en`, not `multi`)
- **Storage Format**: UTF-8 encoded CSV, one term per line
- **Auto-detection**: Show/movie name extracted from parent directory path
- **Shared across episodes**: Same CSV used for all files in show/movie directory

## Speaker Maps

Speaker maps allow you to replace generic "Speaker 0", "Speaker 1" labels with character names in transcripts.

### Auto-Detection (New!)

Speaker maps are now **automatically detected** from two locations (in priority order):

1. **Per-show/movie location (Recommended):** `Transcripts/Speakermap/speakers.csv`
2. **Root directory (Legacy):** `speaker_maps/{ShowName}/speakers.csv`

No manual configuration needed - the system finds and applies speaker maps automatically!

### Directory Structure

**Option 1: Per-Show/Movie (Recommended)**
```
/media/tv/Breaking Bad/Season 01/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Transcripts/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Speakermap/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ speakers.csv    # Auto-detected here first
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ episode.mkv
```

**Option 2: Root Directory (Legacy - Still Supported)**
```
speaker_maps/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Breaking Bad/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ speakers.csv        # Fallback location
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ The Sopranos/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ speakers.csv
```

### CSV Format

Each `speakers.csv` file maps speaker IDs to character names:

```csv
speaker_id,name
0,Walter White
1,Jesse Pinkman
2,Skyler White
3,Hank Schrader
```

### How to Create Speaker Maps

**Method 1: Per-Show Location (Recommended)**

1. Generate a transcript to see speaker IDs
2. Create `Transcripts/Speakermap/speakers.csv` in the show's directory
3. Add speaker ID mappings
4. Reprocess - the speaker map will be auto-detected

**Example for TV Show:**
```bash
cd "/media/tv/Breaking Bad/Season 01"
mkdir -p Transcripts/Speakermap
cat > Transcripts/Speakermap/speakers.csv << EOF
speaker_id,name
0,Walter White
1,Jesse Pinkman
2,Skyler White
EOF
```

**Method 2: Root Directory (Legacy)**

1. Create directory in `speaker_maps/` matching show name
2. Create `speakers.csv` with mappings

```bash
mkdir -p speaker_maps/"Breaking Bad"
cat > speaker_maps/"Breaking Bad"/speakers.csv << EOF
speaker_id,name
0,Walter White
1,Jesse Pinkman
EOF
```

### Features

- **Auto-detection**: No configuration needed, works automatically
- **Per-show organization**: Better file organization alongside transcripts
- **Backwards compatibility**: Legacy `speaker_maps/` directory still works
- **CLI & Web UI support**: Works with both interfaces

**Note:** Speaker IDs are assigned based on voice characteristics and may vary between episodes.

### Example Output

**Without speaker map:**
```
Speaker 0: I am the one who knocks.
Speaker 1: Yeah, science!
```

**With speaker map:**
```
Walter White: I am the one who knocks.
Jesse Pinkman: Yeah, science!
```

## File List Format

Create text files with video paths for batch processing:

```
# Comments start with #
# Empty lines are ignored

# TV Shows
/media/tv/Show Name/Season 01/Episode 01.mkv
/media/tv/Show Name/Season 01/Episode 02.mkv

# Movies
/media/movies/Movie Title (2024).mp4
```

See [`examples/video-list-example.txt`](examples/video-list-example.txt) for a complete example.

## Logs and Statistics

Processing statistics are saved to `deepgram-logs/` in JSON format:

```json
{
  "processed": 5,
  "skipped": 2,
  "failed": 0,
  "total_minutes": 42.5,
  "estimated_cost": 0.18,
  "model": "nova-3",
  "language": "en",
  "start_time": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
  "end_time": "2024-01-15T10:45:00"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Videos Being Skipped

The application skips videos that already have `.eng.srt` files. To reprocess:
1. Use the `FORCE_REGENERATE=1` flag to regenerate without deleting files
2. Or manually delete the existing `.eng.srt` file and run again

### Permission Errors

**Linux:**
If you encounter permission issues:
1. Check the `PUID` and `PGID` values in your `docker-compose.yml`
2. Ensure they match your user's UID/GID (run `id -u` and `id -g` to find them)
3. Set these values in your docker-compose.yml:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - PUID=1000  # Your user ID
     - PGID=1000  # Your group ID
   ```

**macOS/Windows:**
Permission handling is managed by Docker Desktop automatically. If you experience issues:
- Ensure your media directory is accessible to Docker Desktop
- Check Docker Desktop's file sharing settings
- On Windows, verify WSL2 integration is enabled

### API Errors

- Verify your API key is correct in `.env`
- Check your Deepgram account balance at https://console.deepgram.com/
- Ensure you have sufficient API credits

### No Audio Detected

Some videos may fail if:
- The video has no audio track
- The audio is corrupted
- The speech is unclear or heavily distorted

## Advanced Usage

### Integration with Media Servers

This tool works great alongside:
- **Plex** - Automatically recognizes `.eng.srt` files as "English (SRT External)"
- **Jellyfin** - Picks up properly tagged SRT files automatically
- **Bazarr** - Use as a fallback when online subtitles aren't available
- **Emby** - Supports ISO-639-2 language codes for subtitle recognition

### Automation

You can automate subtitle generation using cron:

```bash
# Process new videos daily at 5 AM
0 5 * * * cd /path/to/project && docker compose run --rm -e BATCH_SIZE=50 deepgram-cli
```

- **Distributions:** Tested on Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and Arch Linux
- **File permissions:** Use `PUID` and `PGID` to match your user for proper file ownership

## Web UI (Optional)

The Web UI provides a browser-based interface for managing subtitle generation jobs remotely. This is an **optional feature** - the CLI tool works independently and does not require the Web UI.

### Features

- üåê **Remote access** - Manage transcription from any device via web browser
- üîê **Authentication** - Secure access via OAuth2 proxy (optional)
- ‚ö° **Background processing** - Jobs run asynchronously using Celery workers
- üìä **Real-time progress** - Detailed job status with per-file progress tracking
- üîÑ **Bazarr integration** - Auto-trigger subtitle rescans after batch completion
- üìÅ **Directory browser** - Interactive file selection from your media library
- üéØ **Batch submission** - Queue multiple videos/audio files for processing
- üí∞ **Cost estimation** - Pre-job cost and time estimates using ffprobe
- üîë **Keyterm prompting** - Add custom terminology for improved accuracy (Nova-3, monolingual)
- ‚ùå **Job cancellation** - Cancel in-progress jobs from the UI
- üåç **29 Languages** - Support for all Deepgram-supported languages

### Performance & Scaling

**Processing Speed:**
- Single video: ~2-5 minutes (depending on length and system)
- Parallel processing with multiple workers
- Average throughput: 10-20 hours of video content per hour (with concurrency=2)

**Cost Efficiency:**
- Same Nova-3 pricing: $0.0043/minute
- Batch processing minimizes overhead
- Single Bazarr rescan per batch (vs per-file)
- 24-hour TV season (~10 episodes √ó 45min): ~$1.93 total, ~3-6 hours processing time

**System Requirements:**
- Modest hardware: Works on Intel NUC, Raspberry Pi 4, or similar
- Recommended: 2-4GB RAM, 2+ CPU cores
- Start with `WORKER_CONCURRENCY=1`, scale to 2-3 if system allows
- Storage: Minimal (only `.eng.srt` subtitle files created, ~50KB per episode)

### Setup

1. **Update docker-compose.yml paths:**

```yaml
# Update media path in both web and worker services
volumes:
  - /path/to/your/media:/media:ro
```

2. **Configure environment variables in `.env`:**

```bash
# Required
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_key_here
SECRET_KEY=generate_with_python_secrets

# Optional: Email allowlist for OAuth
ALLOWED_EMAILS=user1@example.com,user2@example.com

# Optional: Bazarr integration
BAZARR_BASE_URL=http://bazarr:6767
BAZARR_API_KEY=your_bazarr_api_key
```

3. **Start Web UI services:**

```bash
# Using make (recommended)
make web-up

# Or using docker compose directly
docker compose up -d redis deepgram-web deepgram-worker
```

4. **Configure reverse proxy:**

Point your subdomain (e.g., `subs.yourdomain.com`) to `http://localhost:5000` (or `http://deepgram-web:5000` if using Docker networks). Configure OAuth2 proxy if you want authentication protection. See [`docs/deepgram-ui-update.md`](docs/deepgram-ui-update.md) for implementation notes.

### Usage

**Access the Web UI:**

Visit your configured subdomain in a web browser to access the interactive interface.

**API endpoints (for programmatic access):**

- `GET /api/config` - Get default model and language settings
- `GET /api/browse?path=/media&show_all=false` - Browse directories and media files
- `GET /api/scan?root=/media/tv` - Scan directory for media without subtitles
- `POST /api/estimate` - Get cost and time estimates for selected files
- `POST /api/submit` - Submit batch of files for processing
  ```json
  {
    "language": "en",
    "files": ["/media/tv/Show/episode.mkv"],
    "force_regenerate": false,
    "enable_transcript": false,
    "speaker_map": null,
    "keyterms": ["ProductName", "TechnicalTerm", "account number"]
  }
  ```
- `GET /api/job/<batch_id>` - Check job status with child task details
- `POST /api/job/<batch_id>/cancel` - Cancel a running job
- `GET /api/progress` - SSE stream for real-time updates

**View logs:**

```bash
# Follow worker logs
make web-logs

# Or directly with docker compose
docker compose logs -f deepgram-web deepgram-worker
```

**Stop services:**

```bash
make web-down
```

### Architecture

- **Flask API** - REST endpoints for job submission and monitoring
- **Celery Workers** - Background task processing with Redis broker
- **Redis** - Message queue and result backend
- **Shared Core** - Same transcription logic as CLI tool

Both CLI and Web UI can run simultaneously on the same media directory. Properly tagged `.eng.srt` files are created next to video files, automatically recognized by Plex, Jellyfin, and other media servers.

### Example Workflows

**Batch process a TV season:**
1. Scan `/media/tv/ShowName/Season 01` via API
2. Submit all 24 episodes as a batch
3. Workers process in parallel (concurrency=2)
4. Bazarr automatically rescans once when batch completes
5. Total time: ~3-4 hours, cost: ~$1.93

**Weekly automation:**
1. Scan entire `/media` directory for new content
2. Submit new episodes in batches of 10
3. Process overnight with minimal system load
4. Review logs in the morning

### Security Notes

- Web UI can be protected with OAuth authentication (configured at reverse proxy level)
- Media mounts should be **read-only** for web container, read-write for worker container (to create `.eng.srt` files)
- Only `.eng.srt` subtitle and transcript files are created (next to source media files)
- Email allowlist available for additional access control via `ALLOWED_EMAILS` environment variable
- API key never exposed to browser (server-side only)
