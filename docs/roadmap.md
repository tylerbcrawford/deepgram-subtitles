## üöÄ V2 Development Priorities

### ü•â Priority 3: Nova-3 Quality Enhancements
**Effort:** Low | **Timeline:** 1-2 days total
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

Optional Nova-3 features for specific use cases. Each should be implemented as a UI toggle in advanced settings:
- [x] Add `numerals=True` parameter (convert "twenty twenty four" ‚Üí "2024")
- [x] Add `filler_words` toggle (optional transcription of "uh", "um" - default OFF for subtitles)
- [x] Add `detect_language=True` (auto-detect language for international content)
- [x] Add `measurements=True` (convert "fifty meters" ‚Üí "50m" for sports/science content)
- [x] **Adjust Nova cost estimator to match actual API charges**
  - [x] Current estimates are ~25% lower than actual charges (e.g., estimated $0.71 vs actual $0.94)
  - [x] Test data: Nova-3 with keyterms batch
  - [x] Implement different rate calculations for Nova-2 vs Nova-3
  - [x] Update cost calculation formula based on real-world data
  - [x] Updated Nova-3 pricing: $0.0057/min (was $0.0043/min)
  - [x] Added Nova-2 pricing constant: $0.0043/min for future language routing
- [x] **Manual testing required**
  - [x] Test each enhancement parameter with sample videos
  - [x] Verify UI toggles work correctly
  - [x] Confirm cost estimation accuracy with actual API usage
  - [x] Validate CLI environment variables

**Benefits:**
- Improved number and date transcription
- Better handling of international content
- More accurate technical/scientific content
- Accurate cost predictions prevent budget surprises

### üîß Priority 4: File Selector UX Refinement
**Effort:** Low | **Timeline:** 1-2 days
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Complete - UI Status Update Issue Discovered

Improve file selection workflow to be more intuitive and prevent confusion with folder navigation.

**Known Issue - Status Display During Batch Processing:**
- **Symptom:** UI shows "‚è≥ Queued - Waiting to start..." throughout entire batch, then jumps to "‚úì Complete" at end
- **Expected:** Should show "‚öôÔ∏è Processing..." with real-time progress (e.g., "3 / 10 completed ‚Ä¢ 2 active (30%)")
- **Backend Status:** ‚úÖ Working perfectly - transcriptions complete successfully in 5-13 seconds per file
- **Frontend Status:** ‚ùå [`updateJobDisplay()`](web/static/app.js:891-941) not receiving state updates or not rendering them
- **Impact:** Low - transcriptions work correctly, just missing visual progress feedback during processing
- **Investigation Needed:**
  - Check if [`/api/job`](web/app.py:322-384) endpoint returning correct state during STARTED phase
  - Verify [`checkJobStatus()`](web/static/app.js:823-866) polling is calling update function
  - Console shows no errors, Network tab shows no failed requests
  - May be timing issue where status polls complete too fast to catch STARTED state
  - Consider adding debug logging to track state transitions

  - [x] Show persistent toast notification during batch processing
  - [x] Ensure banner persists until completion message displays
- [x] Improve job status indicators

  - [x] Display actual job progress with percentage
  - [x] Show real-time progress: completed/total files with active count
