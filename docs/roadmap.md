### üìù Priority 6: Documentation & Branding
**Effort:** Low | **Timeline:** 2-3 hours

Rebrand project and update documentation with story-focused approach for V2 release.

**Branding Updates:**
- [ ] Rename project to **Subgeneratorr**
  - [ ] Update title and branding in README
  - [ ] Update any remaining references in documentation
  - [ ] Ensure consistent naming across all user-facing text

**README Rewrite:**
- [ ] Lead with the origin story
  - Why it was built: filling subtitle gaps in Radarr/Sonarr libraries
  - Bazarr finds most subtitles, but hundreds of episodes were missing
  - Deepgram Nova-3 keyterms testing yielded excellent results with $200 free credits
  - LLM-powered keyterms generation makes accurate transcription accessible
- [ ] Keep technical stack overview near top but concise
- [ ] Target audience: media enthusiasts who care about subtitles and accessibility
- [ ] Add disclaimer: not affiliated with Deepgram or any LLM providers
- [ ] Emphasize: free and open source project for media accessibility
- [ ] Move deep technical implementation details to separate `docs/technical.md` file

**Environment Setup:**
- [ ] Add LLM API key configuration to `.env.example`
  - [ ] Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (optional, for keyterms generation)
  - [ ] Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` (optional, for keyterms generation)
  - [ ] Document that LLM keys are optional features

**Benefits:**
- Clear project identity and memorable name
- Story-driven README that connects with users
- Better documentation organization
- Complete setup instructions

### üé® Priority 7: UI/UX Polish Pass
**Effort:** Low | **Timeline:** 2-3 hours

Final design review and refinement for V2 release.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Complete once-over of GUI and mobile layouts
- [ ] Fix and reorganize elements to prioritize visual hierarchy
- [ ] Review all text and copy for conciseness and clarity
- [ ] Verify all progress indicators work correctly
- [ ] Improve banner integration to prevent text overlap
  - Banners currently cover text in some scenarios
  - Need better z-index management and positioning
- [ ] Make overall design more harmonious and cohesive
- [ ] Final manual evaluation and adjustments across all breakpoints
- [ ] Test visual consistency between desktop, tablet, and mobile views

**Known Issue to Address:**
- [ ] Fix batch processing status display
  - Status update polling works but UI doesn't reflect real-time progress during processing
  - Low impact - transcriptions work correctly, just missing visual feedback

**Benefits:**
- Polished, professional interface
- Consistent visual experience across devices
- Better feedback during batch operations

---

**Target V2 Release:** After Priority 6 (Documentation & Branding), Priority 7 (UI/UX Polish), CLI/GUI feature parity verification, and comprehensive testing

## üöÄ V3 Future Development

### Priority 8: Language Update
**Effort:** Moderate | **Timeline:** 3-5 days

Expand language support by implementing intelligent model routing and multi-language detection.

- [ ] Add Nova-3 "Multi" language support
  - [ ] Implement `language="multi"` parameter for code-switching audio
  - [ ] Add "Multi" option to language dropdown for Nova-3 multi-language detection
  - [ ] Support mixed-language content (e.g., English-Spanish conversations)
- [ ] Update UI with language selection options
  - [ ] Language dropdown with explicit user selection (no auto-detect)
  - [ ] Display which model will be used for selected language
  - [ ] Include "Multi" option in dropdown for Nova-3 multi-language detection
  - [ ] Default to English (monolingual Nova-3) to maximize keyterm benefits
  - [ ] Gray out/disable Nova-3-specific features (keyterms, etc.) when Nova-2 is selected
  - [ ] Dynamically show/hide UI elements based on selected model capabilities
- [ ] **Nova V2 Keywords Integration**
  - [ ] Find a way to work Nova V2 Keywords into the Keyterms Nova-3 terms box
  - [ ] Update UI dynamically when Nova-2 model is selected
  - [ ] Show appropriate keyterms options based on selected model
  - [ ] Hide or gray out Nova-3-only features when Nova-2 is active
- [ ] **Profanity Filter Enhancement**
  - [ ] Update profanity filter radio button implementation for new languages
  - [ ] Ensure radio button interface works with both Nova-2 and Nova-3
  - [ ] Options: Off, Tag, Remove

**Language Coverage:**
- **Nova-3 Exclusive:** 15 languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Russian, Hindi, Indonesian, Norwegian, Turkish)
- **Nova-2 Fallback:** 22 additional languages (Korean, Chinese variants, Catalan, Bulgarian, Estonian, Finnish, and more)
