## üìÖ V2 Final Tasks

### üéØ What's Left for V2 Release

**Critical Path:**
1. **GUI Refresh (Priority 5)** - See detailed implementation tasks below
2. **Testing Phase:** Comprehensive testing of all features including GUI updates
3. **CLI/GUI Feature Parity Verification**
   - Verify CLI offers exact same features as GUI version
   - Ensure both can perform same capabilities and access same variables as choices
   - Some users will only use CLI - must have full feature parity
4. **Documentation Update:** Update README with branding and LLM setup instructions
5. **Environment Setup:** Add API key configuration to `.env.example`

**üìÅ Folder Navigation & Filtering:**
- ‚úÖ Smart folder filtering (only show folders with videos, enabled by default)
- ‚úÖ Cleaned up folder/file tree display
- ‚úÖ Improved folder hierarchy with count display in filter bar

**‚úÖ File Selection & Scope:**
- ‚úÖ Single-click "Select All Files in Folder" button with clear visual feedback
- ‚úÖ Automatic selection clearing when navigating folders
- ‚úÖ Restricted operations to one folder at a time for clarity
