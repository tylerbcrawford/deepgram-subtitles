## üöÄ V2 Development Priorities

### ü•â Priority 3: Nova-3 Quality Enhancements
**Effort:** Low | **Timeline:** 1-2 days total

Optional Nova-3 features for specific use cases. Each should be implemented as a UI toggle in advanced settings:
- [ ] Add `numerals=True` parameter (convert "twenty twenty four" ‚Üí "2024")
- [ ] Add `filler_words` toggle (optional transcription of "uh", "um" - default OFF for subtitles)
- [ ] Add `detect_language=True` (auto-detect language for international content)
- [ ] Add `measurements=True` (convert "fifty meters" ‚Üí "50m" for sports/science content)
- [ ] **Adjust Nova cost estimator to match actual API charges**
  - [ ] Current estimates are ~25% lower than actual charges (e.g., estimated $0.71 vs actual $0.94)
  - [ ] Test data: Nova-3 with keyterms batch
  - [ ] Implement different rate calculations for Nova-2 vs Nova-3
  - [ ] Conduct additional batch tests to gather more data points
  - [ ] Update cost calculation formula based on real-world data

**Benefits:**
- Improved number and date transcription
- Better handling of international content
- More accurate technical/scientific content
- Accurate cost predictions prevent budget surprises

### üîß Priority 4: File Selector UX Refinement
**Effort:** Low | **Timeline:** 1-2 days

Improve file selection workflow to be more intuitive and prevent confusion with folder navigation.

**Current Issues:**
- Files remain selected when navigating away from their folder
- No quick way to select an entire folder at once
- Confusing state when file selection persists across folder changes

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Add "Select All Files in Folder" button/option
  - [ ] Single-click operation to select all videos in current folder
  - [ ] Clear visual feedback when folder is fully selected
- [ ] Enforce folder scope for file operations
  - [ ] Automatically clear file selection when navigating to different folder
  - [ ] Restrict operations to one folder at a time
  - [ ] Show warning if user attempts cross-folder operations
- [ ] Improve selection state visibility
  - [ ] Clear indication of which folder files belong to
  - [ ] Better visual feedback for selected files
  - [ ] Simplified "Clear Selection" workflow
- [ ] Refine batch processing banners and alerts
  - [ ] Fix large blank gap between start and completion messages during batch processing
  - [ ] Keep "Processing..." banner visible throughout entire batch operation
  - [ ] Ensure banner persists until completion message displays
  - [ ] Fix "Job waiting" indicator in sticky menu to show meaningful processing status
  - [ ] Display actual job progress instead of static "waiting" message

**Benefits:**
- Clearer, more predictable file selection behavior
- Faster batch processing of entire folders
- Reduced user confusion and errors
- Better alignment with typical media library organization
- Continuous visual feedback during long batch operations
- Accurate job status information at all times

### üîÑ Priority 5: Language Update
**Effort:** Moderate | **Timeline:** 3-5 days

Expand language support by implementing intelligent model routing and multi-language detection.

**Default Behavior:**
- Monolingual English Nova-3 model with keyterms (default to leverage keyterm feature)
- Intelligent routing to Nova-2 or Nova-3 multi-language based on user selection

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Add Nova-2 fallback for languages not supported by Nova-3
  - [ ] Implement language detection and model routing logic
  - [ ] Route Nova-2-only languages (Korean, Chinese variants, etc.) to Nova-2
  - [ ] See [`docs/nova-languages.csv`](nova-languages.csv) for complete language mapping
- [ ] Add Nova-3 "Multi" language support
  - [ ] Implement `language="multi"` parameter for code-switching audio
  - [ ] Enable automatic language detection within single audio files
  - [ ] Support mixed-language content (e.g., English-Spanish conversations)
- [ ] Update UI with language selection options
  - [ ] Language dropdown or auto-detect option
  - [ ] Display which model will be used for selected language
  - [ ] Show multi-language option for Nova-3
  - [ ] Default to English (monolingual Nova-3) to maximize keyterm benefits
  - [ ] Gray out/disable Nova-3-specific features (keyterms, etc.) when Nova-2 is selected
  - [ ] Dynamically show/hide UI elements based on selected model capabilities

**Language Coverage:**
- **Nova-3 Exclusive:** 15 languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Russian, Hindi, Indonesian, Norwegian, Turkish)
- **Nova-2 Fallback:** 22 additional languages (Korean, Chinese variants, Catalan, Bulgarian, Estonian, Finnish, and more)
- **Multi-Language:** Nova-3 code-switching for mixed-language content

**Benefits:**
- Comprehensive language support across 37+ languages
- Intelligent routing ensures best model for each language
- Support for multilingual content without manual switching

## üìÖ V2 Status & Next Steps

### üîÑ Remaining for V2 Release
- [ ] **Testing Phase:** Comprehensive testing of LLM features
- [ ] **Documentation Update:** Update README with LLM setup instructions
- [ ] **Environment Setup:** Add API key configuration to `.env.example`
- [ ] Nova-3 Quality Enhancements (Priority 3)
- [ ] File Selector UX Refinement (Priority 4)
- [ ] Language Update (Priority 5)

**Target V2 Release:** After testing and documentation completion

## üöÄ V3 Future Development

### Priority 6: Advanced File Input Interface
**Effort:** Moderate | **Timeline:** 1 week

Modern drag-and-drop interface for flexible file selection across multiple folders.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Drag-and-drop file upload interface
  - [ ] Support dropping individual files or entire folders
  - [ ] Visual feedback during drag operation
  - [ ] File validation (video formats only)
- [ ] Multi-folder file list management
  - [ ] Allow adding files from different locations

### Priority 9: Subtitle Synchronization
**Effort:** Moderate-High | **Timeline:** 1-2 weeks
