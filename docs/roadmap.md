## üöÄ Active Development

### üîÑ Priority 5: Language Update (CURRENT PRIORITY)
**Effort:** Moderate | **Timeline:** 3-5 days

Expand language support by implementing intelligent model routing and multi-language detection.

**Default Behavior:**
- Monolingual English Nova-3 model with keyterms (default to leverage keyterm feature)
- Intelligent routing to Nova-2 or Nova-3 multi-language based on user selection

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Add Nova-2 fallback for languages not supported by Nova-3
  - [ ] Implement model routing logic based on user-selected language
  - [ ] Route Nova-2-only languages (Korean, Chinese variants, etc.) to Nova-2
  - [ ] See [`docs/nova-languages.csv`](nova-languages.csv) for complete language mapping
- [ ] Add Nova-3 "Multi" language support
  - [ ] Implement `language="multi"` parameter for code-switching audio
  - [ ] Add "Multi" option to language dropdown for Nova-3 multi-language detection
  - [ ] Support mixed-language content (e.g., English-Spanish conversations)
- [ ] Update UI with language selection options
  - [ ] Language dropdown with explicit user selection (no auto-detect)
  - [ ] Display which model will be used for selected language
  - [ ] Include "Multi" option in dropdown for Nova-3 multi-language detection
  - [ ] Default to English (monolingual Nova-3) to maximize keyterm benefits
  - [ ] Gray out/disable Nova-3-specific features (keyterms, etc.) when Nova-2 is selected
  - [ ] Dynamically show/hide UI elements based on selected model capabilities
- [ ] **Nova V2 Keywords Integration**
  - [ ] Find a way to work Nova V2 Keywords into the Keyterms Nova-3 terms box
  - [ ] Update UI dynamically when Nova-2 model is selected
  - [ ] Show appropriate keyterms options based on selected model
  - [ ] Hide or gray out Nova-3-only features when Nova-2 is active
- [ ] **Profanity Filter Enhancement**
  - [ ] Change profanity filter from dropdown to radio button with 3 options
  - [ ] Options: Off, Tag, Remove
  - [ ] Update both GUI and CLI to support radio button interface

**Language Coverage:**
- **Nova-3 Exclusive:** 15 languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Russian, Hindi, Indonesian, Norwegian, Turkish)
- **Nova-2 Fallback:** 22 additional languages (Korean, Chinese variants, Catalan, Bulgarian, Estonian, Finnish, and more)
- **Multi-Language:** Nova-3 code-switching for mixed-language content

**Benefits:**
- Comprehensive language support across 37+ languages
- Intelligent routing ensures best model for each language
- Support for multilingual content without manual switching

## üìÖ V2 Final Tasks

### üéØ What's Left for V2 Release

**Critical Path:**
1. **Language Update (Priority 5)** - See detailed implementation tasks above
2. **Testing Phase:** Comprehensive testing of LLM features
3. **CLI/GUI Feature Parity Verification**
   - Verify CLI offers exact same features as GUI version
   - Ensure both can perform same capabilities and access same variables as choices
   - Some users will only use CLI - must have full feature parity
4. **Documentation Update:** Update README with LLM setup instructions
5. **Environment Setup:** Add API key configuration to `.env.example`

**Branding and Identity:**
- [ ] New project name: **Subgeneratorr**
- [ ] Update README with story-focused approach
  - Brief technical stack overview near beginning
  - Focus on the story: built to fill subtitle gaps in Radarr/Sonarr libraries
  - Explain Bazarr finds most subtitles, but hundreds of episodes were missing
  - Describe Deepgram Nova-3 keyterms testing success with $200 free credits
  - Highlight LLM-powered keyterms generation feature
- [ ] Add disclaimer: not affiliated with Deepgram or any LLM providers
- [ ] Emphasize: free and open source project for media accessibility
- [ ] Target audience: movie buffs who care about subtitles
- [ ] Move deep technical writing to separate document

**Minor Issue to Address:**
- [ ] Fix batch processing status display (Priority 4 Known Issue)
  - Status update polling works but UI doesn't reflect real-time progress during processing
  - Low impact - transcriptions work correctly, just missing visual feedback

**Target V2 Release:** After language update, testing, and documentation completion

- [ ] Multi-language support with timing preservation

**Note:** Deferred to V3 unless V1/V2 users specifically request it.

---

### Priority 9: Bazarr Auto-Fallback Workflow
**Effort:** Moderate | **Timeline:** 1 week

**Current:** Manual trigger after 24h wait
**Planned:** Automatic fallback via webhook or scheduled scan

- ‚úÖ Completed manual testing of all enhancement parameters

**Benefits Achieved:**
- Improved number and date transcription
- Better handling of international content
- More accurate technical/scientific content
- Accurate cost predictions prevent budget surprises

#### Priority 4: File Selector UX Refinement ‚úÖ
**Completed:** 2025-10-27 | **Effort:** Low | **Timeline:** 1-2 days
**Status:** Implementation complete with one minor UI polish issue remaining

Comprehensive file selection workflow improvements across four areas:

**üìÅ Folder Navigation & Filtering:**
- ‚úÖ Smart folder filtering (only show folders with videos, enabled by default)
- ‚úÖ Cleaned up folder/file tree display
- ‚úÖ Improved folder hierarchy with count display in filter bar

**‚úÖ File Selection & Scope:**
- ‚úÖ Single-click "Select All Files in Folder" button with clear visual feedback
- ‚úÖ Automatic selection clearing when navigating folders
- ‚úÖ Restricted operations to one folder at a time for clarity
- ‚úÖ Enhanced selection state visibility with simplified workflow

**üé® UI Layout & Mobile Optimization:**
- ‚úÖ Reorganized control layout (Audio Language selection prioritized at top)
- ‚úÖ Responsive design for mobile screens (< 768px)
- ‚úÖ Touch-friendly controls (48px+ touch targets)
- ‚úÖ Extra small device support (< 375px)
- ‚úÖ Tablet optimization (769px - 1024px)

**üìä Batch Processing Feedback:**
- ‚úÖ Persistent "Processing..." banner throughout batch operations
- ‚úÖ Real-time progress indicators with percentages
- ‚úÖ Animated loading dots indicator
- ‚úÖ Detailed completion stats (processed, skipped, failed)

**Known Minor Issue:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è UI shows "‚è≥ Queued" throughout entire batch, then jumps to "‚úì Complete"
- Expected: Should show "‚öôÔ∏è Processing..." with real-time progress updates
- Backend: ‚úÖ Works perfectly - transcriptions complete in 5-13 seconds per file
- Frontend: Status polling may complete too fast to catch STARTED state
- Impact: Low - transcriptions work correctly, just missing intermediate visual feedback

**Benefits Achieved:**
- Clearer, more predictable file selection behavior
- Faster batch processing of entire folders
- Reduced user confusion and errors
- Improved mobile experience with touch-friendly controls
- Continuous visual feedback during long operations
