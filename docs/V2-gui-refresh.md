1. The "media" filepath box is too cluttered and ugly. We don't need to show this at all; by default, the program mounts whatever the user has specified as their media folder.

2. The "show folders with videos only" checkbox should be moved to the advanced options section. It should be selected by default whenever the app starts or refreshes.

3. The "5 folders" label is unnecessary and should be removed.

4. Audio language — this doesn't look cohesive. Remove the blue border around it and remove the "-- critical setting" text. This "audio language" dropdown box should be the first thing at the top of this main card (where the media box is now, above the file selector box). The "audio language" title and the language in its dropdown box should be centered.

5. Advanced options — needs to be reorganized and regrouped/renamed to be more transparent and cohesive.

6. The profanity filter should not be a dropdown; it should be a radio button with three options, only one of which can be selected. It should use the same font and checkbox style as all the others. It should be moved into the Nova-3 Quality Enhancements list. It should default to Off on startup and reset.

7. Generate transcript and Save Raw JSON should be in a section called "Transcript Options," styled the same as the Nova-3 Quality section.

8. "Include filler words" should be changed to "Remove filler words" and checked by default on startup or app reset. This will be part of the default options, though the user can adjust it.

9. Converting measurements and converting numbers should be checked by default.

10. Auto-detect language — verify if this is still necessary, considering how the "Multi" feature is now incorporated into the updated language dropdown. Review the plan and roadmap to confirm.

11. AI Keyterms — the button goes too wide. It should be smaller like the Transcribe button, and the text on it should say only "Generate Keyterms" (no emoji or other text).

12. The AI Keyterms generation section has its own card/border, which looks good. Create the same card/border for the "Nova-3 Quality Enhancements" and "Transcript" sections for consistency.

13. "Select All in Folder" should be renamed to "Select All."

14. On mobile view, the "Batch Subtitle" smaller header line is not visible, and there's too much space between the "Subtitle Generator" title and the sticky menu.

15. Review the app to see what features are implemented but not currently exposed in the GUI. Bring all options (like diarization, utterances, paragraphs, etc.) into the GUI as checkboxes, with their current defaults applied and boxes checked on startup.

16. Overall, bring all features into the GUI, set them to the best default settings, and allow the user to override them in the Advanced Options section. Sort them appropriately into either "Transcript Options" or "Nova-3 Quality Enhancements." Ensure they look cohesive with the overall project.
